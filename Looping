## first make the list 
Queen = ['Freddie', 'Roger', 'Brian', 'John']
for Queen_1 in Queen:
	 print(Queen_1) ### must indent this with tab to show it is part of the above line of coding to be looped 

# defines as for each name in Queen, print the name until all are printed 
#so it loops the 'for' and 'print' line until there is nothing left to print


# work can be done within a loop to alter the outcome eg:
for Queen_1 in Queen:
	 print(f"{Queen_1.title()}, play!") ## will make a sentence for each can add further sentences too e.g:
	 print(f"Can't wait for the next song!.\n") #the .\n at the end puts it on a line below 


## can make things for once the loop is done too
for Queen_1 in Queen:
	 print(f"{Queen_1.title()}, play!") ## will make a sentence for each can add further sentences too e.g:
	 print(f"Can't wait for the next song!.\n") #the .\n at the end puts it on a line below 
print("And that's all!") ## put this not tabbed to show the program it isn't part of the loop 
# Make sure to indent all the lines that wish to be looped 

#trying something
for Queen_1 in Queen:
	 print(f"{Queen_1.title()}, play!") ## will make a sentence for each can add further sentences too e.g:
	 print(f"Can't wait for the next song!.\n") #the .\n at the end puts it on a line below 
	 if (Queen_1 == "Freddie"):
	 	print("Ready Freddie!")
	 else:
	 	print()
print("That's all!")


# again but different:

for Queen_1 in Queen:
	if(Queen_1 == "Roger"):
		print("Ready Freddie?!")
	if(Queen_1 == "Freddie"):
		print("Hit it Rog!")
	else:
		print(f"{Queen_1.title()}: 'let's play'")
	print("Can't wait for the next song.\n")
print("Thank you everyone!")


## using numbers:
#use the range(function)
for value in range(1, 5):
	print(value) ## range tells the program the number to start and finsh at, so will not include the final value provided 
# this can be made into a list busing the following:
numbers = list(range(1,20))
print(numbers)
## can alter further by adding a third number to provide the steps between numbers in the list 
numbers_odd = list(range(1,20,2))
print(numbers_odd) ## will always start with the first numbers, so for even numbers:
numbers_even = list(range(2,20,2))
print(numbers_even)

## to make the list with something done to the numbers:
squares=[] ## make an empty list to be filled
for value in range(1,11):
	square = value ** 2 ## to the power of 2
	squares.append(square) ## adjusts the empty list
print(squares)


#can do other sums too
lowered = []
for value in range(3,15): ## for creates a loop for all the values
	less = value -3 ## takes off 3
	lowered.append(less)
print(lowered)

# could also use the code:
higher =[]
for value in range(0,10):
	higher.append(value+5) ## does the two lines of code in one 
print(higher)

# can be done in one line too:
divisions = [value/2 for value in range(1,11)] ## [] defines list, operator and numbers shows the action to take, 'for' shows to create a loop, range shows the list of numbers 
print(divisions)

# to look at specifics of list:

digits = list(range(1,11))
print(min(digits))
print(max(digits))
print(sum(digits))


## can slice and loop
names = ['Jane', 'John', 'Bob', 'Phil', 'Tracy']

print("Some people in the class:")
for name in names[0:3]:
	print(name.title())
## only prints those within the range of [] specified

## can copy a list or a slice to another list e.g:
my_food = ['pizza','chips', 'garlic bread','dips']
friends_food = my_food[:] ## this will copy the whole list 

to_get = my_food[0:2]
print(to_get) ## will copy a slice from a list
