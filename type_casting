## data types 

#bool(true/false), int(whole numbers), float(decimal numbers), and strings (multiple "words" that aren't a list eg: today I went to the zoo)

a =  "today I went to the zoo"
print(a)
type(a)

type(a)

#bool
z = True
type(z)


###### type casting #######

### converting between types
#bool -> int -> float -> string 
#True = 1
#False = 0
True + 7 

#getting an int from a float -- will round to whole number at the start of the number 
int(8.8)
int(8.2)
#both will give the same results 

## automatic typecasting can be done if all can be made the same simply e.g:
True + 3 + int(4.5) ## will give answer of 8 as True is 1 and int will round 4.5 to 4 

b = 3
c = 4.5 
print(type(b)) ### need to add this print if running code in Sublime or it won't appear when build is run
print(type(c))

print(b+int(c)) # will convert c to an int

d = 3 + int('4') ## in this case 4 is a string as it is in ''
print(d)

False + 4 ## this wil equal 4 as False = 0
print(False + 4)
