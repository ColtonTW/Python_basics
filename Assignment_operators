## assigning values to variables 

x=10 
print(x) # outputs 10 

## addition assignment
x +=5 ## basically x = x+5 so will change x by adding 5 once 
print(x)

##subtraction assignment
x -=3 ## will subtract 3 from the existing value of x
print(x)

## multiplication assignment
x *= 2 ## changes the previous value of x by multiplying it by 2 
print(x)

## division assignment 
x/=4 ## divides the current value of x, in this case by 4 -- WILL ALWAYS CREATE A FLOAT 
print(x)

## modulus assignment
x%=3 # gives the remainder of what would happen if current x were divided by the number value, here it is 3 
print(x)

## exponentiation assignment 
x**=2 # equals x to the power of the number given
print(x)

## floor division assignment 
x//=3 # equates to x divided by the number and then rounded down 
print(x)


### Assigning sums to variables - this will give the answers as the output 

# addition
a=10+5
print(a)

#subtraction
b=10-5
print(b)

#muliplication
c=10*5
print(c)

#division
d=10/5 ## remember this will give a float 
print(d)

#modulo
e=10%3
print(e)

#exponents
f=10**2 ##10 squared
print(f)

# floor division
g=10//3 ## 10/3 rounded down
print(g)
