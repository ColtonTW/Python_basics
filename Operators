## Arithmetic operators 
print(10+4) # adds
print(10-4) # subtracts
print(10*4) # multiplies
print(10**4) # ** means to the power of/ acts as an exponent
print(10/4) # divides
print(10//4) # this is division still however it rounds down to the nearest whole number if the answer is a float
print(5%4) # modulo, shows the remiander of a division so will return as 1 

## logical and comparison operators ##
# comparisons return as bools 
print(5>3) # this is a 'not' operator, so will only return true if the ONE requirement is met 

print(5>=3) # this is an 'or' operator, so will return as true is ONE OF TWO requirements are met, in this case if 5 is more than or equal to 3 

print(5!=5) # this means does not equal to, so this would return as false as 5 does equal 5 


print(5==5) ## compares if answers on either side are equal -- can also be done with sums eg:
print(5==2+3)
### = is an assignment operator, == is a comparison DO NOT GET THEM CONFUSED 

## these last two are also called equality operators and can be used even if variables are not of the same datatype
# == asks are they equal 
# != asks are they inequal 
10==20 ## this will be false 

10!=20 # would return true

10==True # would return true as all numbers not 0 equate to True
False==False # woukd return as true

"durga"=="durga" # would return as true 

10=="durga" # would return as false 

### Logical operators 
# and -> if both arguements are true them the result is True - BOTH ARGUEMENTS MUST BE MET 
a = 10
b = 20
if a>0 and b>0:
	print("both a and b are greater than 0")
# this printed because both were met. So it would not work if:
if a>15 and b>15:
	print("hello") ## did not print because the "and" was not met 

# or -> will return true if one of multiple arguements are met as true 
c = 10
d = -5
if a>0 or b>0:
	print("either c or d are greater than 0") ## printed as even though d doesn't meet the requirements, c does 

# the not operator will print if something does not meet the requirements at all 
e = True
if not e:
	print("e if False")
else:
	print("e is True")
