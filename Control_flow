## orders the information, instructions and functions
# executed or evaluated 
# help with decision making 

# two types of statement:

# 1 = conditional:
#for 
#for-else
#for-elif-else  ## use if more than two possible outcomes, use elif as many times as needed 

# 2 = iterative:
#for loop
#while loop
#break
#continue
#pass
#exception and handling --- this is entirely based on the control flow 

#### using conditional statements:
# WAP (write a program) to take 2 numbers from the user and print the larger of the two 

a = int(input("24")) ## this gets something from the user rather than assigning a speific integer
b = int(input("76"))

if a>b:
	print(f"{a} is larger than {b}")
elif b>a:
	print(f"{b} is greater than {a}")
else:
	print(f"The numbers are equal")


## practice - Wap for student's final marks ----- >=90= A, >=80 = B, >=70 =C, >=60=D, else=F

Grades = int(input("Enter the marks: "))


if Grades >=90:
	print("Grade: A")
elif Grades >=80:
	print("Grade: B")
elif Grades >=70:
	print("Grade: C")
elif Grades >=60:
	print("Grade: D")
else:
	print("Grade: F")

### looking at leap years 

year = int(input("Enter the year: "))


if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
	print(f"{year} is a leap year")
else:
	print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
