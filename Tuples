## looks like a list but uses () in pace of []
# can access elements but cannot alter the tuple's contents at all once made
# can add coding to show we are redifining a tuple without actually rewriting it:

dimensions = (200,50)
for dimension in dimensions:
	print(dimension)
# to rewrite it:
dimensions = (200,50)
print("\nOg dimensions:") ## to show the original dimensions
for dimension in dimensions:
	print(dimension)
dimensions = (400,100)
print("\nModded dimensions:")
for dimension in dimensions:
	print(dimension) ## shows there are new values that need to be used and overwrites the previous tuple by adding different values to the variable name 

print(dimensions)

## tuples are usually used to store values for reminders of ranges/values needed for different actions throughout the coding
