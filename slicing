## you can create steps so you only get the variable every x steps eg:
slice_4 = the_list[::2] ## starts at the beginning and prints every second variable
print(slice_4)

slice_5 = the_list[::3] ## prints every third variable
print(slice_5)


## slicing with negative indices (inverses)

slice_6 = the_list[-2:] ## gives the last two from the final element

## to get the list in reverse order put in negative steps 
slice_8 = the_list[::-1] # starts at the end and gives the steps every one from there 
print(slice_8)
