### Remember to put the 'f' at the front if making a sentence with them and add the {} around the list name to ensure the variable is added and not just the name of the list name

# conditional tests help here

band_1 ='Queen' # sets the variable for band one
print(band_1 == 'queen') ## this will return as False because there is a syntax error so band_1 doesn't actually equale the variable we have written here 

# to check for inequality replace the '==' with '!='

# these equalities and inequalities can then be paired with 'if' and 'else'

# can add else: if there is one alternative answer, use elif between if and else if multiple outcomes are possible. eg:

for band in bands:
	if band == "Queen":
		print(f"{band.title()}, is the oldest")
	elif band == "ELO":
		print(f"{band.title()}, is the only non-rock band")
	elif band == "ACDC":
		print(f"{band.title()}, is the heaviest band")
	else:
		print(f"{band.title()}, is the most glam band")


## Can add 'and' statements and 'or'

# A simple way to check if something is in a list:
print('Queen' in bands)
# will give True as it is there
print('Shinedown' in bands) # will return False
