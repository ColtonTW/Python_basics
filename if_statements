## usually paired with an 'else' statement 

bands = ['Queen', 'ELO', 'ACDC', 'Ratt']

for band in bands:
	if band == 'ELO':
		print(f"{band.title()}, not really rock")
	else:
		print(f"{band.title()}, this is rock")

### Remember to put the 'f' at the front if making a sentence with them and add the {} around the list name to ensure the variable is added and not just the name of the list name

# conditional tests help here

band_1 ='Queen' # sets the variable for band one
print(band_1 == 'queen') ## this will return as False because there is a syntax error so band_1 doesn't actually equale the variable we have written here 

# to check for inequality replace the '==' with '!='

# these equalities and inequalities can then be paired with 'if' and 'else'
